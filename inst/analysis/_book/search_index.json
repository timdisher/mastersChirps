We can several ties over time where ranks converge together and we can also see the cuts on day two from the straight lines from that point onwards. One thing I am a little surprised by in the beginning is that once you get out of the best few players you actually get a lot of variability in ranks over days. This makes me regret not taking a little more time to watch because I can see already that daily scores in the pool would have had some potentially big swings. # Match style being used in the slides rank_names &lt;- c(r1_rank = &quot;Day 1&quot;, r2_rank = &quot;Day 2&quot;, r3_rank = &quot;Day 3&quot;, r4_rank = &quot;Day 4&quot;) # Add indicator for players that are cut score_dat &lt;- score_dat %&gt;% mutate(cut = ifelse(is.na(pos), TRUE, FALSE)) tx_def &lt;- function() {theme_xaringan(text_font_size = 10, title_font_size = 10) } score_pdat &lt;- score_dat %&gt;% select(player, r1_rank:r4_rank, cut) %&gt;% pivot_longer(-c(player, cut)) %&gt;% mutate(name = factor(name, levels = names(rank_names), labels = rank_names)) %&gt;% left_join(group_dict) ## Joining, by = &quot;player&quot; base_p &lt;- score_pdat %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = name, y = value, group = player)) + labs(x = &quot;Day of Tournament&quot;, y = &quot;Leaderboard Position&quot;) + scale_y_reverse() + geom_line() + tx_def() base_p + labs(title = &quot;Leaderboard over time - All players&quot;) I don’t really watch a lot of golf so coming in I was expecting players that were cut were generally would have had a bad tournament from the beginning. But we can see that while this is broadly true there were actually a few players who came out strong but had a bad day two. base_p + gghighlight(cut == TRUE) ## Warning: Tried to calculate with group_by(), but the calculation failed. ## Falling back to ungrouped filter operation... ## label_key: player ## Too many data series, skip labeling We can look a little closer at the development of the top ten players over time. It looks like you get a mix of people who pretty much started and stayed there, and others who had a bad first day before finishing strong. base_p + gghighlight(min(value) &lt;= 10) + labs(title = &quot;Leaderboard over time - Ever in Top 10&quot;) ## label_key: player ## Too many data series, skip labeling Even looking at those who finished in the top 10 shows that there is a lot of room to improve and even though you can have a big drop on the second day there is still time to recover. base_p + gghighlight(last(value) &lt;= 10) + labs(title = &quot;Leaderboard over time - Finished in Top 10&quot;) ## label_key: player ## Warning: ggrepel: 10 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider increasing max.overlaps Lastly let’s take a look at anyone who was ever in the top two. There were quite a few players tied for second on day three which must have made the last round exciting since they were all within striking distance of the leader. base_p + gghighlight(min(value) &lt;= 2, use_direct_label = FALSE) + labs(title = &quot;Leaderboard over time - Ever in second place&quot;) Choices for the pool were made based on groups of selections, three from group A and B and two from group C. I assumed that these roughly translated to player ability but it doesn’t seem like group was an overly strong predictor of performance. The cut includes players from all groups and the top performers in the tournament were mostly those from group B. Generally it looks like the top performers in the pool were those that made strong picks from these groups since their size relative to group A also meant they were harder to pick from. Given the large amount of variability within groups I think my original idea of fitting an HLM to identify players who performed better than their group expectation would probably not be very interesting. The original idea there was to look at predictions with/without shrinkage from hierarchical grouping but I’m not convinced it will be worth the effort considering all groups have good spread over all day four positions. score_pdat %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = name, y = value, group = player, colour = group)) + labs(x = &quot;Day of Tournament&quot;, y = &quot;Leaderboard Position&quot;) + scale_y_reverse() + scale_colour_discrete(name = &quot;Group&quot;) + geom_line() + tx_def() score_pdat %&gt;% filter(name == &quot;Day 4&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = name, y = value, fill = group)) + labs(x = &quot;Day of Tournament&quot;, y = &quot;Leaderboard Position&quot;) + geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) + scale_fill_discrete(name = &quot;Group&quot;) + tx_def() 3.2 Pool Performance 3.2.1 Player Choices entry_picks_anon ## # A tibble: 272 x 9 ## pick1 pick2 pick3 pick4 pick5 pick6 pick7 pick8 alt_name ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Jon Rahm Justin Thomas Dustin Johns… Collin Morik… Sungjae Im Sergio Garc… Max Homa Marc Leishm… Zekaria, Jordan ## 2 Bryson Decham… Dustin Johnson Brooks Koepka Collin Morik… Lee Westwood Jason Day Si Woo Kim Phil Mickel… Soule, Benjamin ## 3 Jon Rahm Justin Thomas Jordan Spieth Lee Westwood Tommy Fleetw… Sergio Garc… Ian Poulter Lanto Griff… Palomba, Daniel ## 4 Jon Rahm Dustin Johnson Jordan Spieth Bubba Watson Louis Oosthu… Matt Kuchar Cameron Champ Lanto Griff… Ager, Samantha ## 5 Jon Rahm Xander Schauf… Patrick Cant… Sungjae Im Webb Simpson Cameron Smi… Phil Mickelson Mackenzie H… Rosenlof, Rach… ## 6 Bryson Decham… Jon Rahm Dustin Johns… Patrick Reed Daniel Berger Matt Fitzpa… Phil Mickelson Mackenzie H… Stott, Corie ## 7 Bryson Decham… Dustin Johnson Patrick Cant… Collin Morik… Patrick Reed Tommy Fleet… Victor Perez Matt Wallace Herrera, Aleja… ## 8 Jon Rahm Justin Thomas Dustin Johns… Sungjae Im Webb Simpson Lee Westwood Phil Mickelson Danny Wille… al-Bashara, La… ## 9 Jon Rahm Justin Thomas Jordan Spieth Sungjae Im Cameron Smith Corey Conne… Christiaan Bezuid… Sebastian M… Posey, Jessica ## 10 Dustin Johnson Xander Schauf… Patrick Cant… Viktor Hovla… Adam Scott Corey Conne… Cameron Champ Gary Woodla… Martinez, Eras… ## # … with 262 more rows 3.3 Player Performance 3.4 Overall 3.5 Team Highlight final_scores ## # A tibble: 272 x 5 ## score_1 score_2 score_3 score_4 alt_name ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 258 298 319 303 Zekaria, Jordan ## 2 347 340 355 354 Soule, Benjamin ## 3 296 274 288 276 Palomba, Daniel ## 4 289 267 299 261 Ager, Samantha ## 5 277 312 257 249 Rosenlof, Rachel ## 6 254 274 258 269 Stott, Corie ## 7 329 328 343 357 Herrera, Alejandra ## 8 326 378 340 323 al-Bashara, Labeeb ## 9 197 228 229 211 Posey, Jessica ## 10 226 261 285 286 Martinez, Erasmo ## # … with 262 more rows "]]
